        “I can´t be sitting, I rather stand because I think better. It can be even at home, but I think better if I walk”. These words by Luisa Cunha are very telling regarding her restless character and her understanding of artistic practice. Since her beginnings, Cunha has resisted limiting her work to the traditional spaces of art: the studio and the gallery. She needs to go out, both in order to “hunt” ideas, as well as for finding places to show her works. “Actually I don´t work. I am a pretty idle person. Works show up”, she confessed at some point during the day we spent together in Lisbon, December 11th, 2016. Examples could be sound pieces such as <em>É aquí!</em> (It´s here!), 2010, whose first “spark” came out in a pastry shop, or another one which deals with a meeting by chance: <em>“On the street, everybody stared at the man´s hat…”</em> (1997).
      </p>

      <p>
        Luisa was born in the <em>“freguesía”</em> (neighbourhood) of Santa Maria Maior, in the <em>“baixa”</em>, the very center. By that time Lisbon was different to the African, cosmopolitan, and tourist driven city of the present—which some people begin to address as “the new Berlin”, because of the growing population of artists and curators in the recent times. Cunha says about herself that she is not “a contemporary artist, but an artist of the everyday”. She also acknowledges her roots in the Portuguese context and her affection for the South, as a whole: the Mediterranean sea, Africa, Latin America… In fact, Lisbon is an ideal city for an artist who likes to be in touch with people of all genres and conditions, and reacting to what is going on around her and in the world. The town surrounded by the Tagus is a mid-size city where one can easily find a balance between anonymity and hood conviviality and familiarity. Furthermore, its pleasant weather and legendary luminosity incite the wish to be outdoors and stroll.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cunha did studies on  German philology and uses several languages in her works—depending on her intentions. In 1976 she moved to Madeira and she worked there for eleven years in a school. She made use of her stay in the island to organize a number of projects with local artists, which the Ministry of Culture supported generously, in the period immediately after the Carnage Revolution, in April 1974. The artist still remembers - with a mix of affection and disbelief - the chauffeur and the jeep at her disposal, to drive around the island, moving exhibitions from town to town. Years later she also lived in the Algarve, south of Portugal. When she returned to Lisbon, at thirty-seven, her life shifted and she decided to sign up intoenrol the art school Ar.Co. Our journey began exactly there; at Ar.Co school facilities in Almada, on the opposite shore of the Tagus, looking to Lisboa from a distance.

        “They gave me a lot of freedom. They threw it to me as a soccer ball. In the beginning I didn´t know what to do with it.”. There was a moment, in the late 1980s, in which words were not enough for Cunha. It took some time to her to transform verbal language into visual expression.

        This process took place at Ar.Co, a space which provokes special feelings on her. The school is a private project supported by Costa Cabral family. The venue in Almada is located on a <em>“quinta”</em> (farm) owned by the city council. Workshops are located in different spaces and the students arrive and leave at any time. Sometimes even spending the night. “Being there is like being in another world”, Cunha remarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        While she was a student at Ar.Co, other artists, such as Susanne Themnitz, Joana Vasconcelos —who back then was dedicated to jewellery —and Pedro Gomes (graphic design) were there as well. Her first works were created and shown in the school. Pieces such as <em>Drop the Bomb</em> (1994) or <em>Hello!</em> (1994), which have been exhibited in several international exhibitions and museums, were born in the café or at Ar.Co´s restrooms. Both are sound pieces which play with the modulation of Cunha´s voice and address the viewer directly. Another famous work which came out of this context was one which consist on a radiator, turned on, installed in the courtyard (patio) of the school (<em>Straight to the Point</em>, 1993). Since then, Cunha didn´t cease looking for alternative locations for her projects.

        Recently the artist returned to Ar.Co in Almada, where she also taught, later on, for a new project: a wallpainting in which she appropriates the colour samples made by painters in Lisbon´s buildings, as a preparation, before choosing the exact tone, and painting them over. Its title is <em>Pantone</em> (2016) and the outcome is an abstract and luminous composition—with ochres, yellows, greens, and blues—which creates a contrast with the layer below; old, cracked, and wet. This piece is not only interesting because it takes as a reference one of the most relevant characteristics of Lisbonese vernacular architecture (chromatism and light) but also because it shows how, almost inevitably, many artists go back to painting—or a critical evaluation of the medium—no matter how radical their practices could be.

        In Lisbon, Cunha is part of a vigorous artistic community. She specially appreciates her conversations with artists such as Fernando Ribeiro or Ana Jotta, her dealer, Miguel Nabinho, and younger generations, including André Sousa, Vasco Araújo, Bruno Pacheco, João Onofre, etc… However, the figure that she really admires is quite surprising: Paula Rego, the Portuguese figurative painter, living in London since decades ago, who is a mass-media phenomenon in her country: “She is the work and the work is her. She melts the work, the atelier, and the person. She´s like one of those dolls in her paintings. A free person”.

        Ar.Co is close to another point in Lisbon´s periphery where the artist spends time resting, during the Winter; Costa da Caparica. Her retreat there is a hotel which is less than fifty meters away from the beach, which extends itself along 30 km. outh, reaching Cabo Espichel. In this beach and from her room in the hotel, Cunha took the thirteen pictures that compose her piece <em>It is what it is, in</em> 2015—images of the ocean and the beach which show light´s changes of intensity, ranging between abstraction and figuration.

        At Caparica we found three places that the artist adores: the restaurant Pipo, speciality in grilled fish, the artisanal ice creams of Pope, and the <em>“pastelaria”</em> Compota, where you can find a very unique type of cream puff pastries called <em>“filipinos”</em>.

        After visiting the beach, Luisa drove her car to the restaurant O Cabrinha, a very popular spot in Almada´s old town – a city ruled by the communist party since 1976, and known for its support of the arts and theatre.

        Before going back to Lisbon, through the imposing Ponte do 25 de Abril, we took a short detour into Casa da Cerca to have a <em>“cafezinho”</em>. Casa da Cerca is a small arts center, still in Almada, where Cunha showed a piece in 2013, and from whose terrace and garden you get one of the most impressive panoramas of Lisbon and the Tagus.

        Back in Lisbon, we headed Belém, a neighbourhood by the river, where Luisa lived three years, between 2001 and 2004. That was a specially tough period for her, due to personal issues. She thinks it was then when the second big shift in her career happened, after getting started with her studies at Ar.Co in 1987. That house, rented by a friend, provide her rest and peace when she most needed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of that experience important works came, such as <em>Words for Gardens</em>, created for the Sidney Biennale, in 2004 (invited by the Lisbon-based curator Isabel Carlos), and her first video; <em>Mirror #3</em> (2002-03). This was a piece in which she filmed the surroundings of the house, from all windows, including a skylight and a translucent pavés wall, at four different moments—reflecting the variations in the environment through the day.

        <em>This work</em> represents a constant of Luisa Cunha´s practice, which is related to her interest in identifying her body and space, be it architecture, as in <em>Mirror #3</em>, the city, or even the geography of her country, as we see in the piece <em>Magnetic Needle</em> (2015), performed for the first time in the context of <em>Old School</em>—a project run by curator and critic Susana Pomba in Lisboa. The other relevant element in <em>Mirror #3</em> is that it deals with urban renewal. Nowadays, for example, this work won´t be the same as it was when it was shot, because, just in front of the house, across the highway, the new building of MAAT, the Museo de Arte, Arquitectura y Tecnología, —an institution sponsored by EDP, the Portuguese electric company (sold to a Chinese holding by the government, in 2011,  for €2.700 million),was—inaugurated last October with great fanfare.

        From Belém we got to another space with good memories for Cunha. In this case was the storefront of an old clothes shop, at 122of Calçada da Estrela. There, curator Benedita Pestana ran an alternative space, in 2013-15, called “A montra” (“The Storefront”). The idea was inviting artists to conceive specific projects for this peculiar environment, in a very central area, in which many business were forced to close due to the economic crisis. Cunha´s proposal – <em>I’ll be Back</em> (2013) – involved a photography of another storefront that was also out of business (at her neighbourhood; Areeiro) which was covered with pieces of greaseproof paper and fit perfectly within the showcase at Calçada da Estrela.

        The work was a sort of <em>trompe l’oeil</em>, visible 24/7. It was extremely successful in the vicinity but it also could be easily inadverted or unnoticed, in a context were the only remaining business from old days were the pastry shop and the pharmacy. “A montra” had also a singular audience: passengers of tram 28, which connects the placid Jardim da Estrela with hectic Chiado, and use to get stuck on traffic exactly at that stretch, allowing the contemplation of the projects which used to be shown at the storefront. Cunha´s work was the succinct, almost imperceptible, representation of a specially critical moment in Lisbon and Portugal´s recent history. From our perspective in the present moment, this work speaks also about the contemporary cycle of the city; modernization, crisis, and gentrification.

        This cycle is rampant nowadays—with the city becoming a new “must” destination for tourism, artists, and start-ups -, and strongly appeared again on the last stop of our journey, at the Largo da Academia de Belas Artes, in Chiado.

        In this square Cunha conceived the project for a public art work (never accomplished/materialized), and we witness the new phase of the city “boiling”. Prestigious brands such as Balthaup and other luxury stores, as well as a profuse offer of rental apartments for holidays (Airbnb, Prime Suites…) kick out traditional shops, rise up rental prices for locals, and provoke a worrying homogenization of space.

        In front of this reality, Largo da Academia has an intimate meaning for Cunha: her grandfather was a director of the Fine Arts School, in the first half of the 20th Century, and influenced her very much. Her idea to transform this space— not very graceful, urbanistically —consisted in “intervening without producing an object”.

        For that matter, the typical Lisbon cobblestone should be removed and substituted by a “tartar” surface/layer in a light blue tone. On top of the tartar, simple descriptions of the build environment would be written: <em>“Doce janelas, duas varandas, uma porta, catro platibandas, uma chaminé…”</em> With this gesture, Cunha´s work not only invited to look out, at the city and the river, but also contributed to create a “oasis of peace”, on a dynamic and noisy area.

        Getting to the end/reaching this point, it might be obvious that Luisa Cunha´s work is characterized, often times, by a powerful centripetal impulse. Her pieces draw vertiginous “escape lines” towards exterior space. They resist being static or be trapped by architecture. When we did this route through Lisbon, Luisa anticipated the project for a performance that was going to happen in the end of January 2017, at the artist-run-space, O armario e a sala, located at the same building as  “Montra” used to be. The action, titled Beyond the Line (2017), was supposed to happen like this: in a space which is normally used as a painting class, in an independent art school, Arte Ilimitada, <em>the artist placed herself, standing alone, on the opposite side of the audience</em>. Cunha began drawing a line with chalk on the floor, alongcovering the wide of the room, and parallel to the public facing her. Immediately after, she draw another line, closer to the people. And so on, until she got closer and closer to the audience. After a certain point, the viewers were “forced” to get together, and, eventually, cram/squeeze. Finally, they were  pushed out of the room to the street, where Lisbon nightlife awaited.
