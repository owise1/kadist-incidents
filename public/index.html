              Such mundane, often-neglected urban nooks and crannies are Hong Kong artist <a href="http://www.nadimabbas.com/">Nadim Abbas's</a> habitat. That's Nadim camouflaged in grey, the second from the right. His curiosity about these fields of concrete blocks was first piqued while riding a regular bus route through the tangle of roads at the mouth of the Western Harbour Crossing. A novel experience of this marginal site – the trigger for his 2012 installation <a href="http://hk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/859124/the-pathology-of-hong-kong-in-the-work-of-artist-nadim-abbas">Afternoon in Utopia</a> – was ensured when Latitudes approached Nadim to develop a <a href="http://www.wdw.nl/nadim-abbas-tour-incidents-of-travel-hong-kong/">day-long tour</a> as glimpse into his practice, a public studio visit of Hong Kong that became part of <a href="http://www.lttds.org/projects/moderations/">Incidents of Travel</a>. "The usual explanation for this strangely monumental arrangement of blocks", Nadim explains in his meticulous <a href="http://www.lttds.org/projects/moderations/Nadim_Abbas_IncidentsOfTravel.pdf">itinerary</a> notes to the 19 January 2013 tour, "is to discourage the homeless population from sleeping on the islands. I see it also as a way for the authorities to mark their territory, much like a dog urinates on a lamppost". Questions abide. What tone of grey is the legal status of these curious concrete islands, "perpetually overlooked because they exist on the boundaries of function and visibility" in Nadim’s words? What would J.G. Ballard or his character <a href="http://www.ballardian.com/biblio-concrete-island">Robert Maitland</a> have made of these interstices of Hong Kong's concrete jungle?

              <p>Some important information: Lawrence Weiner’s preferred single malt whisky is <a href="http://www.scapamalt.com/OurWhisky/Scapa16yearold.aspx">Scapa 16 Year Old</a> (“Sweet and velvety on the nose ... slightly dry with the merest hint of the sea”). His favourite blended whisky is <a href="https://www.thefamousgrouse.com/age-verification?destination=our-whiskies/famous-grouse">The Famous Grouse</a> ("rich, sweet, well-rounded"). Yet for shooting the breeze on the seawall of Barcelona’s port on the sunny afternoon of October 7th 2008, a dram of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardhu_distillery">Cardhu 12</a> ("an easy-going, charming Speysider") in a plastic cup would do.</p>
              <p>Here Lawrence and the always-debonair <a href="http://sergiaguilar.ws/web/">Sergi Aguilar</a>, artist and director of the Fundació Suñol, toast the <a href="http://www.lttds.org/projects/weiner/">Latitudes-curated project</a> and the first of a four-part fabrication of Lawrence’s <a href="http://www.sciartinamerica.com/uploads/6/0/8/9/6089526/6248611_orig.jpg">statement</a> A CLOTH OF COTTON WRAPPED AROUND A HORSESHOE OF IRON TOSSED UPON THE CREST OF A WAVE. Horseshoes had been <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lttds/4254852002/in/set-72157623036706507">wrapped</a> in cotton cloths (<a href="http://tela.cat/ca/12-farcell">tela de farcell</a>, of course) and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lttds/4254085137/in/set-72157623036706507">hurled</a> into the Mediterranean.</p>

              <p>We came bearing gifts, Well, the proofs of the <a href="http://www.lttds.org/totes/aballi/">edition</a> of tote bags that Ignasi Aballí had designed for Latitudes's 10-year birthday. (Need to carry things around? <a href="http://www.lttds.org/totes/">We can help</a>.) What is going on in Ignasi’s studio is the result of innumerable forces. He is on the phone. Floorboards creek, dust breeds. Small canvases have had cosmetics applied to them – liquid foundation in different skin tones. They are drying. MAC products do create a more flawless finish we later learn, but they are taking longer to dry out than those from Sephora. Slides of famous paintings and sculptures – the highlights of an art history lecturer, now spurned for Powerpoint – have been stuck to the studio windows for years. They are gradually bleaching in the sunlight. The hoard of El País newspapers numbers one more than the day before as it awaits Ignasi’s sedulous scissor-snipping. Newsprint is a sort of metabolic regulator: "tres días, 36 horas, 15 días, siete segundos, 27 horas, ocho días, 31 días, una hora ...", <a href="http://1995-2015.undo.net/it/mostra/22740">for example</a>. </p>
              <p>One of us remembers that in 1957, William Burroughs spent a <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4424/the-art-of-fiction-no-36-william-s-burroughs">month</a> staring at his toe. Ignasi-time at the moment does not allow for that kind of duration – in the autumn he will be opening a solo exhibition at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid and next year he has another major show at the Fundació Joan Miró here in Barcelona. Those art history slides may well appear in some form, paler still. We are happy that Ignasi is happy with the bag and glad to revisit the project we made with him in Beijing in 2009. Following the title of that exhibition, the bag reads precisely “NOTHING” on one side and imprecisely “SOMETHING” on the other. If it was in Chinese it would read 没有, 有.</p>

              <p>Thee first person we emailed when we received the invitation to participate in the <a href="http://www.lttds.org/projects/gertrude/">Visiting Curator Program</a> of <a href="http://www.gertrude.org.au/programs/visiting-curators/">Gertrude Contemporary</a> in late 2013 was <a href="http://www.nicholasmangan.com/">Nicholas Mangan</a>. Born Geelong, Australia; lives and works in Melbourne, Australia. We had been corresponding with Nick for several years and had moreover discovered we had a friend in common, the irrepressible <a href="http://www.martianson.net/castellano/">Martí Anson</a>. (Nick and Martí had got to know each other in 2009 during their participation in <a href="http://santafelucky7.newmexicoculture.org/">SITE Santa Fe</a>.)</p>
              <p>Fortunately Nick would be in town during the first few days of our Melbourne soujourn in May 2014, yet had to leave soon after to film for his new project, ironically enough, here in Spain. We have been eagerly tracking the development of Ancient Lights since Nick first told us he was working towards a solo show for London’s <a href="http://www.chisenhale.org.uk/archive/exhibitions/index.php?id=175">Chisenhale Gallery</a> and Sydney’s <a href="http://keirfoundation.org/project/nick-mangan-project-chisenhale-london-artspace-sydney/">Artspace</a>. The show opened in London on 2 July, and following Mariana's recent Mousse interview and Max's <a href="http://www.lttds.org/assets/Interview_with_Mangan_by_Canepa%20Luna_%20Mousse_47.pdf">Frieze feature</a>, Latitudes was in conversation with Nick at the Chisenhale on Tuesday 7 July. You can watch video documentation of the event <a href="https://vimeo.com/134081774">here</a>.</p>
              <p>As described in the '<a href="http://frieze.com/issue/article/landscape-artist/">Landscape Artist</a>' feature, one screen of Ancient Lights "features high-speed footage of a spinning coin, a Mexican ten peso piece minted with an image of the Aztec Sun Stone, a carving central to our understanding of the Aztec calendar and the civilization’s belief that human sacrifice was necessary to the ongoing life of the sun."</p>

              <p>"The Giant Camera plays a role in a film I haven’t yet made", <a href="http://tomorrowmorning.net/">Amy Balkin</a> reveals as we strain to see the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/refuge/farallon/">Farallon Islands</a> way off the coast of San Francisco, California. Back in 2006, we had featured Amy’s work <a href="http://www.thisisthepublicdomain.org/">This is the Public Domain</a> (2003–ongoing) in <a href="http://www.lttds.org/projects/landart/">Land, Art: A Cultural Ecology Handbook and Public Smog</a> (2004–ongoing) in the 2008 exhibition <a href="http://www.lttds.org/projects/greenwashing/">Greenwashing</a>, yet we had never met in person before. She explains that observations of wildlife at the Farallons this year have confirmed the disruptive effects of an <a href="http://www.fws.gov/refuge/farallon/warmweather.html">unusual</a> period of warm ocean temperatures due to <a href="http://www.elnino.noaa.gov/">El Niño</a> and climate change. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7OsX5fNQQE/">Seal Rocks</a> are impossible to miss from where we stand at Point Lobos at the north end of Ocean Beach as they’re right off shore from the famous <a href="https://www.cliffhouse.com/history/index.html">Cliff House</a>. Amy tells us that the rocks were once the site of the earliest <a href="http://www.outsidelands.org/wave-motor.php">experiments</a> in wave power and tidal energy in California. Moreover, Seal Rocks would have once actually had seals on them.</p>
              <p>We spend 3rd September exploring this and several other sites across San Francisco through Amy's eyes, projects and concerns. (<a href="http://www.lttds.org/assets/Amy_Balkin_IncidentsOfTravel.pdf">Here</a> is a pdf of the whole itinerary.) Part of a series of artists' tours or expanded studio visits ongoing since <a href="http://www.lttds.org/projects/sucursal/">2012</a> under the moniker <em>Incidents of Travel</em>, our thought-provoking day with Amy – alongside those with archivists Megan & Rick <a href="http://www.prelingerlibrary.org/home/">Prelinger</a> and the collective <a href="http://wearewillbrown.com/">Will Brown</a> – took place during Latitudes' <a href="http://www.lttds.org/projects/kadist/">residency</a> at <a href="http://kadist.org/">Kadist Art Foundation</a>. </p>
              <p>Pay three bucks to enter the <a href="http://www.giantcamera.com/">Giant Camera</a> and you can see the spectacular view of Seal Rocks and the Pacific magnified seven times as it is cast pin-sharp on a two-metre <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7O-iwQNQe8/">parabolic screen</a>. Although the jaunty exterior of the <a href="http://www.essentialvermeer.com/camera_obscura/co_one.html%20/l%20.VfaWn3u8SMI">camera obscura</a> has been extensively modified over the years, its mechanism has essentially remained unchanged since the 1940s when it formed part of the attractions at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg2ifB8KxPs">Playland</a> amusement park.</p>
