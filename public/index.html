                  In the itinerant lives of artists and curators, studio visits can be rare moments of convening. Since 2013 when I first visited Chicago, I have had a meeting artist <a target="_blank" href="http://cargocollective.com/haroldmendez">Harold Mendez</a> on my agenda. Then, as with now, our individual trajectories meant that we were unable to share the same space for an extended period of time. So we nevertheless engaged in rudimentary conversation via email, social media posts and the occasional mail delivery. A couple of months ago when we finally got to meet following my recent relocation to Chicago, it was over drinks and dinner at the popular Hyde Park Chicago spot <a  target="_blank" href="http://promontorychicago.com/">The Promontory</a> that our conversations came to life. Without physical works at our disposal, our exchange ranged from discussing mutual artists friends, to new lives in new contexts, and to the varying themes that drive the work – history, memory, materiality and spatial politics.
                </p>
	              <p>
                  A Chicago native of Mexican and Colombian descent, Harold works across sculpture, drawing and installation. He is a deft hand at interrogating the material cultures and histories of the old and new world. Earlier this year, in Mexico City where our paths connected once more, we spoke about landscape and affect, belonging and transnational identities, narrative retelling through the archive, and the ethnographic paradigm in art. Chicago was once again our meeting point for Incidents (of Travel) and our conversation meandered through these familiar themes, brought into relief by Harold’s hometown knowledge and insights into his former life as a graffiti artist. Tales of early years spent working on the fringes of city’s urban fabric—old train depots, tunnels and railway tracks—speak to Harold’s interest in spatial matters. Yet graffiti’s stylized illustrations and its bold tagging seemed at first somewhat removed from the unassuming gesturesgestures that ground his Harold’s work today. Through the course of our conversation, I would come to understand that the two are not unrelated—the handicraft, DIY culture and detailed rendering in graffiti sowed seeds for the strong material concerns and surface exploration of Harold’s recent work.

                <h3>
                  Ando Gallery, The Art Institute of Chicago
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Upon entering the Ando Gallery at the Art Institute of Chicago you recognize an internal silencing slowly taking place. Whenever I visit the Art Institute, I either begin or end my trip here. It’s a sparse room that includes sixteen freestanding dark-stained oak columns that give you the sense that you’re in a forest at dusk. Tadao Ando, the architect, designed the gallery for the display of Japanese screens. It can feel as if it isn’t part of any one place. It’s also strangely it’s own environment and you can easily forget you’re in a museum. Passing through the columns always reminds me of when I was a child hunting for flying bats in a pine forest near La Estrella, Medellín, Colombia (where I spent many summers visiting family). Beyond the columns you walk across a dark-floored space and see a set of seamless glass panels. In the back corner of the gallery are two long backless benches where you can sit and view the screens or the columns at a distance. It’s a space that allows me to be in several places at once—where you can let time slip away here. I’m into that.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Lower Wacker Drive (in search of a door that leads into the subway tunnels, which I passed through between 1992–1999)
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We didn’t find the door but maybe it’s for the best. Lower Wacker Drive was once a tent city for the homeless and a stretch of Chicago where vandals, graffiti artists, criminals and those that did dirt at night found a space (one of many in the city) to be without being seen. Now, it seems like an industrialized and highly guarded subterranean zone where no such activity is evident. The figure you see in the photograph descending a spiral staircase (beyond Lower Wacker Drive) is me carrying a bag full of spray paint in the mid to late nineties. At the time, I entered through a door with several friends who were part of a graffiti collective with a key we obtained—it now escapes my memory of how we came to possess it. There’s a different atmosphere in subway tunnels compared to subway stations and there’s a cinematic drama present down there that I had a desire and ability to explore. What was once between the thresholds of that door no longer fully applies but at least I went through it. For me, that door somehow mirrors Andreï Tarkovski’s 1979 film, Stalker in which a guide leads two men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.

                <h3>
                  Cho Sun Ok Restaurant (Korean BBQ), 4200 North Lincoln Avenue
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Cho Sun Ok is one of the oldest Korean restaurants in Chicago and I have been coming here for years with my son or with friends to feast. Throughout the restaurant you’ll notice large quartz crystals, perhaps for prosperity. It’s a small place where the food is made grill-top style, which includes banchan (side dishes) with rice. Banchan is generally served in odd numbers for good luck. These small accompaniments (kimchi; stir-fried-dried anchovies; lotus root; seaweed; bean sprouts; fish cakes; and tofu amongst others) are served in tiny bowls and range in flavor and presentation. It’s ethnic comfort food I often seek out and I am particularly interested in supporting restaurants like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For our visit we ordered the following dishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Appetizer:<br/>
                  Haemul Pajeon - Korean pancake with seafood and scallions
                </p>

                <p>
                  Appetizer Soup:<br/>
                  Duk Guk - Korean rice cakes in mild beef broth soup (contains egg)
                  Yukgaejang - Beef broth soup with shredded beef and vegetables (hot and spicy)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Tabletop Cooking:<br/>
                  Bulgogi - Sliced tender beef marinated in house specialty sauce (served with banchan)
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Margie’s Candies (formally Fannie Mae Chocolates), 1813 Montrose Avenue
                </h3>
                <p>
                  An impromptu, surprise stop for Somi.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  An ‘X’ near the Wilson Train Yards, Red Line
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Another impromptu stop near the Wilson Train Yards (which burned down in 1996). I pointed out how structural steel beams that make an ‘X’ shape along the ‘L’ (elevated train line) were used as a ladder to access the train tracks and rooftops in order to paint trains and walls, or evade the police. I know of several entry points like this throughout Chicago along the ‘L’ or subway lines. The police once chased me in this yard for painting graffiti on the trains. To escape, I had to hang underneath the elevated train tracks as a train passed above and then make my way towards an ‘X’ to get away. Accessing these impassable spaces provided me with a fundamental understanding of taking risks.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Montrose Beach (Los Blobs), 4400 N. Lake Shore Drive
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Between 2004–2008 I spent a portion of my summers walking along the lakefront photographing the unregulated economies of immigrants selling inflatable beach toys, flowers, and foodstuffs such as cotton candy, popcorn, elotes (corn on the cob) or fruit. It’s a place where material vestiges and their potential meanings became an important thing to pay attention to. Many of these ephemeral materials can be found in several of my sculptures or installations and they are things I return to often. In a photograph of mine from 2006, you can see what appears to be a figure selling inflatable beach toys in a leisurely setting. You don’t see that it’s a woman or that she’s an immigrant. You don’t see a body, only her feet sporting blue-and-white Nike shoes. What you see is more like a blob of capitalism represented by colour, shape and form. There’s something inherently poetic in this image, but I’m more interested in what it points to—a state of being that is both visible and invisible.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  The Dead Yards (in search of a graveyard for decommissioned subway trains or “Whatever lurks ahead of grievous abominations and disorder, you and me walk into it together”)
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Although we didn’t make it to the Dead Yards (not its official name) during our visit, I do know where it exists but I am choosing to keep my memory of this site to myself and for those that know where it is. The Dead Yard is a graveyard for decommissioned subway trains and it was a location I frequented in my youth as a graffiti artist. When I think about it, it’s a site where I learned to experiment creatively and work collaboratively while being undetected in the night. It was an important place (although dangerous to access) that lead me to become an artist. Now that I have distance from these memories, the Yards aren’t about the aimless vandalism I engaged in; they’re closer to articulating a voice beyond the trappings of a place.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  The Franklin, East Garfield Park, 3522 W Franklin Blvd
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Chicago has a decades long history of alternative gallery spaces and many artists, including me, began their careers here. It’s an important non-commercial component of the artistic community. Edra Soto and Dan Sullivan started The Franklin in 2012, an artist-run project space located in the backyard of their home in East Garfield Park. It was was initiated by an installation that Soto and Sullivan developed titled LIVING by Example, (Living as in Martha Stewart Living magazine), alluding to DIY approaches and their relationship with the artist-run culture in Chicago. For the installation they designed and fabricated a gazebo-like structure to display their personal art collection, which was acquired through non-profit spaces and trading with other artists. It’s a vibrant and dynamic space with yearlong activity, promising visibility, free space and support to professional artists that would like to create projects in response to the structure or to engage with the East Garfield Park community. The Franklin reflects a perennial questioning of what home is as well as demonstrating ways that it can change and expand.

                  <a href="https://www.google.be/#q=art+institute+of+chicago&gws_rd=cr" target="_blank">Chicago’s Art Institute</a> is populated with treasures from around the world. Pausing here for a moment, we considered the use of natural rubber in this mask that we thought was intended to mimic the texture of human skin. The object <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/155960?search_no=1&index=0" target="_blank">information</a> however reveals a different use, as this is in fact a backing once used to hold bright red Abrus seeds in place. We briefly searched for a sculpture from the Americas that rendered human skin with an interesting technique but it was nowhere to be found in the museum’s labyrinths of galleries. Elsewhere we found textiles, jewelry and sculptures impeccably crafted by hand. Harold has a curiosity about materials and craft that is ignited in moments like this, our conversation soon turned to the use of natural dyes in the Americas and Africa. Early on in his career Harold travelled to Ghana to learn and work with these techniques. One of his sculptures titled <a href="http://cargocollective.com/haroldmendez/Burial-Party-Panic-dwindled" target="_blank"><i>Burial Party & Panic dwindled...</i></a>, 2011 repurposes a hand painted black Kente funeral cloth traditionally worn when mourning the dead. The cloth is in fact not a solid black but gradations of black sealed with a waxed coating.

                  With the loss of cell phone reception and endlessly meandering roads, it’s easy to get lost down here. Like Lewis Carroll’s Alice we were looking for a door, one that Harold used to access the subway tunnels in his earlier years. We never found that door, but we passed by many others along the way. This is a space of entryways and exits, portals to buildings up above or indeed other undiscovered places. This is also a space of fantastical imaginings, having played host to several <a href="http://cargocollective.com/haroldmendez/Burial-Party-Panic-dwindled" target="_blank">Hollywood Blockbusters</a>. The ultimate non-place, Lower Wacker Drive is certainly not as spectacular as Chicago’s famed architecture up above, nevertheless it hints at the endless possibility of the city itself. There is surely a metaphor in this.

                  We stopped at <a href="http://www.margiesfinecandies.com/">Margie’s Candies</a> briefly to cater to my sweet tooth. Harold would often stop by here with his brother en route to school, foregoing paying for the ‘L’ (Elevated train) to spend his monies on their offerings. While in Mexico City together earlier this year, I beamed ecstatically as we came across a table of colorful Mexican sweets—the salty-sweet taste of a tamarind ball reminding me of homemade confectionaries ecstatically consumed during my childhood years in Lagos. How does one represent home and the space of the domestic? Harold often uses unconventional materials in his work—popcorn, cotton candy, and other found objects—to evoke the texture, smell and sentiment of home.

                  There is something unbelievably democratic about the Lakefront in Chicago. Stretching the length of the city, it is the connecting artery of an urban landscape that is starkly racial and economically segregated. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.margiesfinecandies.com/">1909 Burnham Plan</a> expressly declared: “Not a foot of its [Lake Michigan’s] shores should be appropriated to the exclusion of the people.” This plan has been kept largely intact by the city with one or two exceptions. Like many other post-industrial cities of its kind in the Midwest U.S., Chicago is currently exploring ways to repurpose its industrial architecture and address its vast stretches of vacant land. Neighborhoods are being gentrified and communities continue to be displaced. But the lake remains available to all, calling forth an ethos of social democracy that was the backbone of America’s golden era of industrialization.

                  The bright colors of these discarded birthday candles reference a cotton candy sculpture Harold made for the 2015 <a href="http://robertpruittartist.tumblr.com/post/102372921209/pop-up-sculpture-park-2701-blodgett-houston-tx" target="_blank"><i>People’s Pop-Up Sculpture Park</i></a> organized by fellow artist <a href="http://www.robert-pruitt.com/" target="_blank">Robert Pruitt</a> in vacant property lots in Houston’s 3rd Ward. Harold set it on fire and watched it disintegrate – the colors turning darker and black over time. Working with material residues—both literal and figurative—is a recurrent theme in Harold’s work. There is something nostalgic about these familiar tokens from everyday life, a feeling that is only deepened by their slow destruction.

                  En route to find The Dead Yards in Skokie, we serendipitously came across this street vendor at a stoplight. We rolled down the windows and hastily grabbed a few shots as he worked his way through the army of stationary cars. As he approached our car, he waved at the camera and smiled.

                  With much of our conversation revolving around notions of home, it was fitting that we would end the day at the house of close friends of Harold’s. <a href="http://thefranklinoutdoor.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The Franklin</a>, directed by artist <a href="http://thefranklinoutdoor.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Edra de Soto</a> and her designer husband Dan Sullivan, is one of the many apartment galleries that make up Chicago’s unique art scene. Located in Chicago’s East Garfield Park, a popular neighborhood for artist studios and artist-run initiatives, it is a warm and welcoming space for the avid art lover hoping to find some of the city and the nation’s up-and-coming voices. On view was the exhibition transmissions: algoritmos, polyrhythms, karuraqmi puririnay curated by William Cordova. The main gallery is in an <a href="http://thefranklinoutdoor.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">outdoor pavilion</a> designed by Dan, open to the elements and open year around, it defies the infamous Chicago weather. The Franklin is a site of radical hospitality – Edra and Dan are great hosts, and during our visit we were treated to soup, wine and conversation.

                  As if by design, when we arrived at The Franklin, Harold’s book <a href="http://thefranklinoutdoor.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><i>Texts for nothing</i></a> was front and center on Edra and Dan’s coffee table. This publication was produced in 2011 for <a href="http://thefranklinoutdoor.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><i>Future Plan & Program</i></a>, a publishing project organized by artist Steffani Jemison featuring book-length conceptual literary works by artists and was presented at Project Row Houses. The Studio Museum in Harlem commissioned Harold in 2013 to do a live performance (working with two actors) titled A <i>blurred and generalized projection of you and me</i>. The performance was part of the exhibition <a href="http://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/fore" target="_blank">Fore</a>, which was the fourth installment of the Studio Museum in Harlem’s ‘F’ series, following <i>Freestyle</i> (2001), <i>Frequency</i> (2005–06) and <i>Flow</i> (2008).
